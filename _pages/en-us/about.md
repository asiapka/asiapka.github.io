I'm a PhD Candidate at the KU Leuven Centre for IT &amp; IP Law (CiTiP). I was previously a Research Associate at CiTiP, conducting ethical and legal research on emerging technologies for interdisciplinary projects funded by the European Commission. My research lies at the intersection of AI, law and ethics, with a specific focus on the future of work, and is supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO). My thesis is titled ["WORK, AI & ARISTOTLE: Towards a Flourishing-Centred Paradigm for the Future of Work"]({{ site.baseurl }}/thesis/).

I've studied law, public administration, and philosophy at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences, and King's College London, respectively. Beyond academia, I've been a long-time advocate of equal and diverse representation in the IT industry.
